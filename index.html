  <h3><a href="/switch/RCMReboot">RCMReboot</a></h3>
  <p>I do not condone using this app if your SD card is EXFAT formatted.<br>natinusala & ctcaer pointed out that Atmosphere's method to reboot to RCM, and therefore the method used by this app, does not properly shutdown HOS so there is some unquantified risk of file corruption. Still use at your own risk on fat32, but just don't use it on exfat please.<br><br>Intended for use on Switches that don't have AutoRCM installed.<br><br>This uses a new feature added to exosphere in Atmosphere 0.8.1, so it won't work in other CFWs unless they add it in a compatible way. Also Atmosphere 0.8.1 got a silent update with a bug fix to get this feature working, so if you already downloaded it before sometime on 1st Dec you might need to update it again (if it crashes with an orange screen instead of going to RCM, you need to update). There's a commit hash in the filename, make sure you have atmosphere-0.8.1-master-bd76e73 (or if you're living in the future, Atmosphere 0.8.2 or higher will be fine too). It sounds like it currently only works if you load Atmosphere using fusee-primary.bin, not if you use hekate to load Atmosphere as separate files (using hekate to load fusee-primary.bin is ok). This will likely be fixed when hekate is updated.<br><br>There are two versions included in the zip, each available as an .nro (put it in its folder inside the \"switch\" folder on the root of your sd card) and as an installable .nsp (install with the stupidly-named installer of your choice).<br>- RCMRebootInstant will reboot to RCM as soon as it loads.<br>- RCMReboot will give you a 5 second countdown with a chance to change your mind.<br><br>The reason RCMReboot is a much bigger file than the Instant version is that I used cpasjuste's cross2d library to put stuff on screen, mostly because I've been using it for the other project I'm working on and it saved me time. Sweet library, check it out.<br><br>Credits to cpasjuste for the aforementioned cross2d, re.lax for nro2nsp (which uses hacbrewpack by the-4n), SciresM for Atmosphere, libnx, and for fixing the bugs in them I found while making this, and everyone else who worked on Atmosphere, libnx, devkitpro and all that good stuff.<br><br>Source included for peace of mind, and in case of licence requirement. If I've got anything horribly wrong with licensing or credits just let me know. If you want to build it yourself you'll need libnx updated with the latest commit (which isn't in a release build at the time of writing), and to figure out the cross2d setup for the non-Instant version.</p>

  <h3><a href="/switch/Goldleaf">Goldleaf</a></h3>
  <p>Easy-to-use title installer & manager for Nintendo Switch<br><br>If you are looking for Tinfoil, this is Tinfoil's safer and way more extended evolution.<br>Brief description<br>Goldleaf is a multipurpose tool, specialized on title installing from NSP packages, but with other utilities, such as NAND/SD browsing,<br><br>You can easily manage title-related stuff, like install titles via NSP packages or uninstall already installed titles.<br><br>If you know what FBI is (related to 3DS homebrew), this is a similar project for Nintendo Switch.<br><br>Disclaimer<br>Installing NSP packages can be dangerous.<br><br>Keep in mind that there will always be a ban risk, and that NSPs with tickets are specially dangerous.<br><br>If you want to be safe, avoid connecting to the internet via airplane mode, or block Nintendo's services via special tools such as 90DNS.<br><br>Goldleaf simply provides support for a normal NSP and/or ticket installation. The way you use them or the risks you are taking are your problem.<br><br>Goldleaf gives the user the possibility to modify NAND files, by deleting them or allowing to copy new files there.<br><br>This can be dangerous, as deleting NCAs from the NAND contents can lead to unfixable errors. Image deleting all the EXE and DLL files from System32 folder. Well, the result would be similar.<br><br>Removing tickets from installed contents will make the system not to be able to recognise them as \"legit\" purchased, so it will refuse to launch them (in many cases, but NOT all cases)<br><br>Main features<br>SD card and NAND browser<br><br>A very simple but, in my opinion, one of the most useful features in Goldleaf. Just a file browser for the SD card or for NAND partitions, providing special support for some file formats:<br><br>NSP (Nintendo Submission Package)<br><br>It's the official format used by Nintendo to provide installable content from their CDN servers.<br><br>Technically, it's a PFS0 (a simple file format containing several files) with NCA contents, sometimes XML and/or icon metadata (exported by official packaging tools), and a ticket and a cert in case they are signed with a titlekey (games are, system contents aren't).<br><br>Goldleaf can install NSPs same way other official apps would, like DevMenu.<br><br>As a warning, I do not recommend installing NSPs in case you plan to go online. Installing content from unofficial tools (such as Goldleaf or the old Tinfoil) can lead to permanent bans from online services, and in severe cases, from every Nintendo service, even from updating the console or games. Install NSPs at your own risk.<br><br>NRO (Nintendo Relocatable Object)<br><br>Officially is treated as a dynamic library object, similar to DLLs on Windows. This are loaded dynamically by applications at runtime.<br><br>Homebrew uses them as executable binaries because as they can contain multiple data sections, we can use them to load extra info such as NACP (title, author and version), an icon, or even RomFs data to access at runtime.<br><br>Goldleaf has the ability of launching NROs located at the SD card. Keep in mind that this feature usually can cause undefined behavior due to some difficulties cleaning up graphics so quickly.<br><br>NCA (Nintendo Content Archive)<br><br>This format is the base format used by Horizon OS to store content.<br><br>While the previously mentioned formats don't require any kind of cryptography to be extracted or used, NCAs have to be decrypted, so the user is required to provide the required keys to extract the content.<br><br>NCAs have different sections, as well as other information. The two main sections are the ExeFs and RomFs: the ExeFs filesystem contains the code NSO binaries and a NPDM metadata file, while the RomFs contains different files to be accessed from the title.<br><br>Some NCAs could also contain a special section, which is the section 0. This section contains the PNG and GIF logos displayed at the top-left and botton-right of the console when launching a title.<br><br>NCAs don't have neccessarily those two sections. The program NCA, the base of any application or applet, will contain an ExeFs, and usually a RomFs in case it's a game or a system title with resources like settings or Home Menu.<br><br>Appart from program NCAs there are some other NCA types: control NCA (NACP and icons), legalinfo NCA (HTML manuals and information), offline NCA (HTML documents in case the title wants to load them) content meta CNMT NCA (with title specific information)...<br><br>Goldleaf has embedded hactool in his code, so it can extract those partitions from NCAs, if the keys are provided.<br><br>NXTheme (Home Menu theme)<br><br>This format is developed by Qcean team, a format to handle Home Menu layout modding.<br><br>+Goldleaf can install them, but it needs to have Home Menu's RomFs at sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch. If the keys used with other formats are provided, Goldleaf itself will locate the console's qlaunch and extract it to that directory.<br><br>You will have to reboot with CFW after installing a theme to see any changes.<br><br>NACP (Nintendo Application Control Property)<br><br>This is the format used by Nintendo to store a title's name, version, author name and other information, like if the title supports screnshots or video captures.<br><br>Goldleaf can parse a NACP file and display some of it's information.<br><br>Tickets and certificates<br><br>Tickets (.tik) and certificates (.cert) are the format used by Nintendo to provide encryption data for titlekey-signed titles (almost every game).<br><br>NSPs usually contain them, and Goldleaf can install them if they are located in the SD card.<br><br>To install a ticket you will have to provide a certificate, both with the same name and in the same directory, with their extension. (example: sd:/game.tik and sd:/game.cert)<br><br>The NAND browser has almost the same support, but it's reccomended to use it only to export files via copying them to the SD card, to avoid any trouble. Goldleaf should warn when doing dangerous operations anyway.<br><br>USB installer and Goldtree<br><br>You can install NSPs via USB using Goldtree, a C# PC client to handle this installations.<br><br>Keep in mind that USB installations are a bit unstable, and might bug sometimes.<br><br>Title manager<br><br>Goldleaf's title manager will display all the titles installed in the system, both SD, NAND and the one in the gamecart if inserted.<br><br>You can view these titles' information, icon, install location and Application Id.<br><br>Titles can also be completely uninstalled here. Keep in mind that deleting a title won't delete its savedata, that should stay on the system.<br><br>Ticket manager<br><br>Goldleaf can get all the tickets installed on the console. While some of them will contain the name of the title they belong to, some could belong to DLC or other types of content despite not belonging directly to a title.<br><br>You can view the Application Id and the key generation of a ticket by selecting it.<br><br>Tickets can also be removed from the console. Removing tickets can be a dangerous option, as without them, titlekey-signed won't be allowed to boot by Home Menu.<br><br>CFW configuration<br><br>This is mostly a useful menu for checking which CFWs are in the SD card and whichof them have any Home Menu modifications, meaning that a theme is probably installed there.<br><br>You can delete any Home Menu modifications of a certain CFW after selecting a CFW.<br><br>Console information<br><br>On this option, you can check the used size of the SD card, the entire NAND, and on the different NAND partitions.<br><br>It also displays the current firmware version the console is.<br><br>About<br><br>Displays Goldleaf's logo and whether Goldleaf is running as a NRO from hbmenu or as a normal title.<br><br>As some other miscellaneous options, you can easily reboot or shut down your console from Goldleaf, by pressing ZL or ZR in any moment.<br><br>Providing keys<br>If you provide a file with several Switch keys (commonly named as prod.keys or keys.dat) you will be able to do some extra stuff with Goldleaf: (remember that you have to place it as sd:/goldleaf/keys.dat)<br><br>Unless you already have dumped qlaunch's (aka Home Menu) RomFs (or at least the files within lyt folder) in sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch directory, you will need to provide the previously mentioned key file with several keys, so that Goldleaf can extract directly the RomFs of the console's qlaunch contents to use it.<br><br>You have the option to extract NCA contents (ExeFs, RomFs or section 0), but you will need the previously mentioned keys too.<br><br>Goldtree and USB installs<br>USB communication is slightly different from Tinfoil's one, so Tinfoil's old Python script, AluminumFoil nor other tools won't work properly.<br><br>Goldtree will ask you to choose a NSP after establishing connection with Goldleaf, and it will be received and installed by Goldleaf.<br><br>Keep in mind that USB support is a bit unstable, and sometimes it might fail. Anyway, it should work most of the times.<br><br>Basic controls<br>The controls are quite intuitive in Goldleaf, but here you have a brief explanation of them:<br><br>Press A to select options from menus, browse folders, or in case it's a file, to browse a menu with file options (copy, delete...)<br><br>Press B to cancel a dialog or to go back to the previous page / menu.<br><br>Press X to paste the path of the clipboard. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)<br><br>Press Y to browse a menu with directory options, similar to the one used with files, instead of browsing the directory. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)<br><br>Press ZL or ZR anywhere to browse a menu with reboot / shut down options, in case you want to reboot or shut down the console.<br><br>Press Plus (+) or Minus (-) to exit Goldleaf and return to hbmenu. This option is only available if Goldleaf is loaded as a NRO binary. (more special cases like this one below)<br><br>Movement is quite obvious. Using the L-stick, the R-stick or the D-pad you can move through menu or dialog options. On menus (like the file browsers or the main menu) the R-stick provides a way faster scrolling.<br><br>Special features<br>Goldleaf differs on some features depending on whether it is loaded as a NRO or as an installed title:<br><br>Goldleaf can be exited via Plus (+) or Minus (-) buttons if it's loaded as a NRO, but as regular titles have to be exited from the Home Menu, this feature is not available as a title.<br><br>Goldleaf disables Home button pressing while installing a NSP if it's loaded as a title, but this feature isn't available as a NRO binary for technical reasons related to applets.<br><br>Goldleaf cannot launch NRO binaries if it's loaded as a title due to technical reasons. They can only be launched from another NRO binary.<br><br>Issues and support<br>In case you find a bug or you need help with Goldleaf, you have several places to ask.<br><br>Many errors are very common and can be misunderstood, and you should document a bit for some errors instead of directly calling them issues:<br><br>It's a common issue for some NSPs, although they are completely valid ones, being detected as wrong NSPs. Although they can be really wrong NSPs, it is usually caused by firmware mismatch. For instance, in case you are trying to install a title which requires at least 5.1.0 version (which uses key generation 4) on a lower firmware version, it won't be recognised as a valid NSP for cryptographical reasons. (the console cannot decrypt the NSP because it is encrypted with unknown keys which are within 5.1.0 update)<br><br>The USB installation can sometimes freeze in the middle of the install. If that happens, try closing Goldleaf and Goldtree, uninstalling the wrongly-installed title and retrying.</p>

Argon recieved this name because its chemical inactivity.<br><br>Argon NX is an immutable payload which is injected to your Nintendo Switch via Fusee Gelee exploit.<br><br>Purpose<br>The purpose of Argon NX is to stay immutable, so you can always inject it, without caring about other payloads getting updated (Always use ArgonNX for TegraSmash, TegraGUI, TrinkedM0 ...).<br><br>How can it be?<br>When Argon NX is injected it automatically launches the payload.bin loacted at argon directory on your SD Card root.<br><br>If payload.bin is not present or VOOLUME DOWN button is pressed on payload injection, Argon NX will list all payloads located at argon/payloads, and you will be able tp select one of theme to launch it.<br><br>If you want, you can choose a payload logo by adding a 32 argb bmp(200*200) file named as the payload to argon/logos directory.<br><br>Compatibility<br>Works with all cfw payloads. Not tested with TeamXecuter SXOS payloat but it should work too.<br><br></p>

  <h3><a href="/switch/RCMRebootInstant">RCMRebootInstant</a></h3>
  <p>I do not condone using this app if your SD card is EXFAT formatted.<br>natinusala & ctcaer pointed out that Atmosphere's method to reboot to RCM, and therefore the method used by this app, does not properly shutdown HOS so there is some unquantified risk of file corruption. Still use at your own risk on fat32, but just don't use it on exfat please.<br><br>Intended for use on Switches that don't have AutoRCM installed.<br><br>This uses a new feature added to exosphere in Atmosphere 0.8.1, so it won't work in other CFWs unless they add it in a compatible way. Also Atmosphere 0.8.1 got a silent update with a bug fix to get this feature working, so if you already downloaded it before sometime on 1st Dec you might need to update it again (if it crashes with an orange screen instead of going to RCM, you need to update). There's a commit hash in the filename, make sure you have atmosphere-0.8.1-master-bd76e73 (or if you're living in the future, Atmosphere 0.8.2 or higher will be fine too). It sounds like it currently only works if you load Atmosphere using fusee-primary.bin, not if you use hekate to load Atmosphere as separate files (using hekate to load fusee-primary.bin is ok). This will likely be fixed when hekate is updated.<br><br>There are two versions included in the zip, each available as an .nro (put it in its folder inside the \"switch\" folder on the root of your sd card) and as an installable .nsp (install with the stupidly-named installer of your choice).<br>- RCMRebootInstant will reboot to RCM as soon as it loads.<br>- RCMReboot will give you a 5 second countdown with a chance to change your mind.<br><br>The reason RCMReboot is a much bigger file than the Instant version is that I used cpasjuste's cross2d library to put stuff on screen, mostly because I've been using it for the other project I'm working on and it saved me time. Sweet library, check it out.<br><br>Credits to cpasjuste for the aforementioned cross2d, re.lax for nro2nsp (which uses hacbrewpack by the-4n), SciresM for Atmosphere, libnx, and for fixing the bugs in them I found while making this, and everyone else who worked on Atmosphere, libnx, devkitpro and all that good stuff.<br><br>Source included for peace of mind, and in case of licence requirement. If I've got anything horribly wrong with licensing or credits just let me know. If you want to build it yourself you'll need libnx updated with the latest commit (which isn't in a release build at the time of writing), and to figure out the cross2d setup for the non-Instant version.</p>

Well, now you can play your games portably anywhere in your house!<br><br>This project is fairly new, so please do not consider it totally stable. If you encounter issues, feel free to submit them.<br><br><br>Features:<br><br>- Stream PC screen to a Nintendo Switch in your local network<br>- 720p (full Switch-Tablet display resolution)<br>- 40-60 FPS (if not see Troubleshooting)<br>- Low delay (again, see Troubleshooting)<br>- Capture controller input on Nintendo Switch<br>- Emulate an Xbox controller on the PC<br>- PC app offers picture quality adjustments<br><br><br>How to Use:<br><br>For the PC App, you will need to execute In-Home-Switching.exe which you can download from:<br>https://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/releases<br><br>On PC, Scp drivers must also be installed (just unzip and execute Driver Installer/ScpDriverInstaller.exe). Otherwise the program will crash silently.<br><br>Also please set your PC resolution to 1280x720p in Windows for getting much better performance of screen capturing while running the app.<br><br>On the Switch, find out its IP address (in the Internet settings) and start the app with your Switch CFW. Then type in the Switch's IP address on the PC app and hit the Connect button.<br><br><br>Current Limitations:<br><br>- Only works with Windows 8 (64-bit) and newer<br>- No audio support atm<br>- No support for Switch CFW other than Atmosph\u00e8re or Kosmos<br><br><br>Known issues:<br><br>- So far Switch crashes when put to sleep with app running (please close app beforehand, we have not fixed this issue yet)<br>- App breaks when Switch changes from docked to handheld mode or vice-versa. Please quit the app before doing so.<br><br><br>Further notices:<br><br>This app uses core overclocking to 1785 MHz on the Nintendo Switch. We use this measure in order to decode the incoming videos efficiently. As far as we know, there have been no reported cases of this damaging any devices. In other words, it is considered safe. Still we do not warrant for any potential device damage caused by this homebrew.<br><br><br>Troubleshooting:<br><br>-- Nice videos, but sadly that delay makes it unplayable --<br><br>If you are experiencing delays greater than 0.1 seconds, either your PC is just too slow for your chosen quality options (try worsening image quality) or your local network is bad. Basically we need instant data transfer in your network to work properly (this has nothing to do with throughput, just latency).<br>Some WiFi-routers unfortunately just aren't up to the task.<br><br>-- These framedrops hurt my eyes! --<br><br>Your PC is probably too slow for encoding with the games/applications on. Try other applications, lower image quality and, if you haven't already, set your PC screen resolution to 1280x720p (saves scaling).<br><br>-- No drops, but my framerate is just very low --<br><br>Well, in our tests we had 60 FPS on Windows 10 with low image quality... I guess you can try the same strategies as for fixing framedrops, I hope that helps.<br><br><br>License:<br><br>This code is licensed GPLv3 and this has a reason: We do not want to see (or read about) any parts of this project in non-open-source software (everything that is not GPLv3 licensed).

  <p>The game<br>Lugaru (pronounced Loo-GAH-roo) is a cross-platform third-person action game. The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat skills. In his quest to find those responsible for slaughtering his village, he uncovers a far-reaching conspiracy involving the corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the starving wolves from a nearby den. Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save his fellow rabbits from slavery.<br><br>History<br>Lugaru was originally developed by David Rosen of Wolfire Games and was open sourced in 2010. It was made cross-platform with the help of Ryan C. Gordon.<br><br>Various forks were made at that time, and the most interesting developments were put back together under the OSS Lugaru organization, originally on Google Code and then on Bitbucket.<br><br>This new repository on GitLab is run by the same team, and aims at revitalizing the development effort to clean things up, ensuring the code base builds and runs fine on all supported platforms, and easing the packaging of Lugaru in Linux distributions.<br><br>Ideally, the updated code base could also be used to update the Lugaru HD version sold by Wolfire Games once proven better than the current commercial builds.<br><br>Run it through hbloader or hbmenu.nsp.

Files required:<br><br>bios7.bin, 16KB: ARM7 BIOS<br>bios9.bin, 4KB: ARM9 BIOS<br>firmware.bin, 128/256/512KB: firmware<br>Firmware boot requires a firmware dump from an original DS or DS Lite. DS firmwares dumped from a DSi or 3DS aren't bootable and only contain configuration data, thus they are only suitable when booting games directly.<br><br>Possible firmware sizes<br>128KB: DSi/3DS DS-mode firmware (reduced size due to lacking bootcode)<br>256KB: regular DS firmware<br>512KB: iQue DS firmware<br>DS BIOS dumps from a 3DS can be used with no compatibility issues. DSi BIOS dumps should be usable too, provided they were dumped properly.<br><br>As for the rest, the interface should be pretty straightforward. If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask, though!</p>

  <p>Usage<br>This Download installs for both Atmosphere and ReiNX.<br><br>According to tests, should work on any CFW which allows NSP sysmodules (Atmosphere, ReiNX).<br><br>You also have to set the boot2 flag, whose location depends on the CFW:<br><br>Atmosphere: create a file named boot2.flag inside titles/0100000000000352/flags directory.<br><br>ReiNX: create a file named boot2.flag inside titles/0100000000000352 directory.<br><br>Combos<br>All the input combos are performed with R-Stick pressing and pressing the D-pad in an specific direction (at the same time). Combos must (should) be done before or after the game starts looking for amiibos.<br><br>Toggle amiibo emulation: Press R-Stick (like it was a button) and also pressing the D-pad up. Toggles/untoggles emulation.<br><br>Toggle amiibo emulation once: Same as above, but pressing the D-pad right. Toggles emulation once, after emulating an amiibo then it will untoggle automatically.<br><br>Untoggle amiibo emulation: Same as above, but pressing the D-pad down. Untoggles amiibo emulation, and should be used as a way to fully ensure it is untoggled, in case you don't know whether it's toggled or not.<br><br>Swap amiibo: Same as above, but pressing the D-pad left. Moves to the next amiibo in the amiibo directory, if last one starts again with the first one. Only has effect if amiibo emulation is toggled.<br><br>Emuiibo's amiibo directory is sd:/emuiibo. Place your amiibo dumps (must be *.bin files) there.<br><br>Amiibo emulation<br>Emuiibo gets amiibo's data, but the register info (amiibo name, write dates, mii) is auto-generated, as it isn't present on amiibo dumps:<br><br>Name will be the file's name (Amiibo.bin -> Amiibo), but if the name is bigger than 10 chars it will be hardcoded to Emuiibo.<br><br>Write date is hardcoded to 15th June 2019.<br><br>The amiibo's mii (owner) is hardcoded to the first mii found in the console mii database.<br><br>Amiibo dumps<br>Dumps consist on *.bin files, which must be 540 bytes (perhaps even more?). They can be dumped with several tools.<br><br>For developers<br>This MitM process also hosts a custom service, nfp:emu, which can be used to control amiibo swapping and emulation by IPC.<br><br>You have an implementation for C/C++ and libnx in here.<br><br>Credits<br>All the persons who contributed to the nfp-mitm project before me: Subv, ogniK, averne, spx01, SciresM<br><br>libstratosphere libraries (SciresM again)<br><br><br>.<br></p>

  <h3><a href="/switch/noies">NoiES</a></h3>
  <p>I present to you my own original NES emulator for the Switch, NoiES! This entire emulator was written from scratch by me. I started this project just to teach myself about how emulators are made so that I can work on larger projects in the future, but it went farther than I originally expected and is now pretty much a full-fledged emulator, apart from some minor inaccuracies and some missing mappers.<br><br>But there are already other NES emulators for the Switch, why use this one?<br>Well, no reason in particular. As I said before, this was more a learning experience for me, but I ported it to the Switch for the homebrew bounty and I might as well release it. I suppose the biggest advantage I can offer is that since I developed the entire emulator core myself I am very familiar with it and can easily dive in to fix bugs and add new features.<br><br>Minor inaccuracies?<br>Yes, well, I've yet to test my CPU timing for cycle accuracy so no promises there. There are also some minor timing issues with the PPU, particularly with the MMC3 IRQ counter, which can be seen in the slight vibration of the status bar in Kirby's Adventure. Another odd bug I found is that I can't seem to navigate the items menu in The Legend of Zelda. Oh, and the audio system is still kind of a work in progress, so you might notice crackles (especially in docked mode!), missing sounds, or things that sound slightly off. (Wow, doing a great job selling it here)<br><br>Mappers?<br>Right. Every ROM has a mapper; it's basically what loads different portions of the ROM memory into the CPU memory for execution. I've implemented mappers 1 through 4, which should cover a large portion of the NES library. If you have any particular games you want to play that aren't supported, tell me the mapper number (the emulator will tell you which one it is if it isn't supported) so I can place higher priority on implementing it.</p>

  <h3><a href="/switch/NX-ntpc">NX-ntpc</a></h3>
  <p>A crude NTP client for the Switch.<br><br>What's it do?<br>It contacts a time server at http://ntp.org and sets the Nintendo Switch's clock appropriately.<br><br>Run the NRO from the hbmenu, or send it over nxlink. An internet connection is required for this application to work, but it does not contact Nintendo's servers, so it should be friendly in 90DNS and other Nintendo-blocked environments. If \"Synchronise Clock via Internet\" (in System Settings -> System -> Date & Time) is enabled before launching this application, the time will automatically update correctly on the console's Home Screen. If it is not enabled, the application will ask if you wish to enable it, and then reboot afterward to correct the time, or offer a way to exit without enabling internet time sync.</p>

It is not part of your savefile, it contains human-readable additional informations about the save itself and it will also be used by Svitch to import the save back in the system (as soon as the function will be ready).If you wish to import the .svi files back into your system with the use of a different tool you can easily decompress the archive, scrap away svitch_saveheader.svh and re-import it normally.</p>

It only informs ReverseNX to create needed files in correct folders for first game you will boot and it will stay in that way. After booting first game you need to set again new performance mode if you want to change already set performance modes or create a new one. So changing performance mode works only for first game you will boot after setting performance mode in titleid operation mode of ReverseNX-Tool!<br><br>\"No change flag detected.

Title information are loaded automatically.<br><br>Working path<br><br>Checkpoint relies on the following folders to store the files it generates. Note that all the working directories are automatically generated on first launch (or when Checkpoint finds a new title that doesn't have a working directory yet).<br><br> - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint: root path<br> - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint/config.json: custom configuration file<br> - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint/saves/<title id> <game title>: root path for all the save backups for a generic game<br><br>Usage<br><br>Checkpoint for Switch only runs on homebrew launcher. Make sure you're running up-to-date payloads.<br><br>The first launch will take considerably longer than usual (usually 1-2 minutes depending on how many titles you have installed), due to the working directories being created - Checkpoint will be significatively faster upon launch from then on.<br><br>You can scroll between the title list with the DPAD/LR and target a title with A when the selector is on it.

Your rom files must be zipped and named as per this set. You'll find in the 'database' directory this file as backup/reference (Super Nintendo Entertainment System - hyperspin.xml) + a complete set from dat-o-matic (datomatic.no-intro.org). Rename this file to 'db.xml' and (re)place it in the same directory as the executable to use this one. You can make your own database file with filtering from this great website.</p>

  <h3><a href="/switch/SysDVR">SysDVR</a></h3>
  <p>This is an experimental sysmodule that allows capturing the running game output to a pc via USB or network connection.<br>Two versions are provided:<br><br>SysDVR.zip is the \"full\" version, can stream using both modes and comes with an homebrew app to switch between them<br>SysDVR-USB-Only.zip(not included in this download) will only stream via USB but uses less memory and should run alongside multiple sysmodules.<br>You should use the full version unless you have specific requirements.<br><br>To play the stream mpv player is recommended as it's the most straight forward to set up, any other player that supports raw h264 streams via tcp or stdin should work but you may have to configure it manually.<br><br>Limitations<br>Video quality is fixed to 720p @ 30fps with h264 compression (hardware limit)<br>Audio quality is fixed to 16bit PCM @ 48kHz stereo. Not compressed<br>Only works on games that have video recording enabled (aka you can long-press the capture button to save a video)<br>Video and audio are two different streams, they're likely to desync as they require two different player instances. Vlc does support a secondary audio stream but i didn't manage to get it working properly.<br>Only captures game output. System UI, home menu and homebrews running as applet won't be captured<br>Video feed is not realtime, there will always be a minimum of ~1 second of delay.<br>Stream quality depends heavily on the environment, bad usb wires or low wifi signal can affect it significantly.<br>USB streaming is not available when docked<br>Requires firmware >= 6.0.0<br>Clearly with these limitations this sysmodule doesn't allow \"remote play\" and does not replace a capture card.<br><br>Usage<br>Setting up the sysmodule<br>The provided builds already contain the correct file structure, you should just be able to extract them to your sd card.<br>CFWs other than atmosphere should work but I won't provide support for them.<br><br>By default SysDVR will stream over network, to switch between modes and set the default one you can use the SysDVR Settings homebrew included in the zip.<br><br>Network streaming<br>This is the easiest way to stream, In this mode the sysmodule is completely standalone, you should be able to play the video stream just by running mpv tcp://<switch ip address>:6666 --no-correct-pts --fps=30 and mpv tcp://<switch ip addr>:6667 --no-video --demuxer=rawaudio --demuxer-rawaudio-rate=48000 for audio.<br>When using network streaming it's not recommended to stream both audio and video at the same time as it may cause slowdowns. In general network streaming has more lag and delay compared to USB, it is worth the time to set it up, especially for gameplay recording.<br><br>USB streaming<br>To stream via usb you need the UsbStream program, it's built using .NET core and is compatible with linux as well.<br>First of all you should make sure to install .NET core 3 on your pc, then proceed to setup the drivers, this step is needed only the first time:<br><br>Driver setup on windows<br>On windows you may get the device not found or platform not supported errors or very bad performance on the stream, in this case you may have the wrong driver set up.<br>Plug your switch in the computer while running SysDVR in USB mode and launch zadig install the libusb-win32 driver for the \"Nintendo Switch\" device. Before installing make sure the target device USB ID is 057e 3006, if it's different the sysmodule may not be running, try waiting a bit (it should start around 20 seconds after the console boot) or check again your setup.<br>This won't interfere with other applications that communicate with the switch via usb as this sysmodule uses a different product id.<br><br>Driver setup on linux<br>On linux you may have errors about loading the libusb-1.0 library, this happens when the file name is different than the one expected by dotnet, you can make a symlink as described on the LibUsbDotNet repo:<br>sudo find / -name \"libusb-1.0*.so*\" and then<br><br>cd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu<br>sudo ln -s libusb-1.0.so.0 libusb-1.0.so<br>(Example commands, change the paths with the one you find on your pc)<br><br>Streaming<br>Most Windows users can simply use UsbStreamGUI, it will allow you to select the streaming mode and launch UsbStream directly.<br><br>Linux users will have to use the UsbStream command line interface (Note that this is available on windows too and provides a few more options compared to UsbStreamGUI)<br>Launch UsbStream like this: UsbStream video <streaming mode> <arg> audio <streaming mode> <arg><br>These are valid streaming modes:<br><br>stdin : pipes the received data directly to a video player via stdin, this will use no caching so you'll have low delay but it may lag. This will likely require you to provide the args to pass to the player, you can do so like this: video stdin <player executable> args \"<args list>\"<br>mpv : same as stdin but will automatically set up the args for mpv so it just requires the path<br>tcp : opens a tcp server so players can connect to it and use their own caching mechanism to remove or reduce lag (at the price of an higher delay)<br>file : writes the received data directly to a file so it can be converted to a common format later.<br>When using mpv the arg is the path of mpv on your pc (use the .com file on windows), you have to repeat it twice if using both streams.<br>The tcp option requires a free port number and the file option the output file path.<br>To disable a stream just omit the name and its fields.<br><br>Example commands:<br><br>UsbStream audio mpv C:/programs/mpv/mpv : Plays audio via mpv located at C:/programs/mpv/mpv, video is ignored<br>UsbStream video mpv ./mpv audio mpv ./mpv : Plays video and audio via mpv (path has to be specified twice)<br>UsbStream video tcp 1337 audio file C:/audio.raw : Streams video over port 1337 while saving audio to disk<br>Launching UsbStream without any parameter will display more options and examples.<br>To connect to the tcp streams you can use: mpv tcp://localhost:<video port> --no-correct-pts --fps=30 for video and mpv tcp://localhost:<audio port> --no-video --demuxer=rawaudio --demuxer-rawaudio-rate=48000 for audio<br><br>Tips<br>To get the most out of this sysmodule you will have to do some testing to find configuration that works best for you, here are some tips and useful information:<br><br>If the video stream doesn't start immediately try moving the camera around in the game, to display something the video player needs to acquire a video keyframe first.<br>An usb 3 wire is slightly better than usb 2, but both should work.<br>Quality also depends on the cpu utilization of the game you're running, OC can improve performances.<br>Using cache will reduce lags at the cost of an higher delay, for mpv it's on by default (except when using usb stream with mpv mode), if you want to try without it the command line arg for mpv is --cache=no --cache-secs=0. There's a lot of room for experimenting here, try different values to find the combination that works best for you.<br>If using no caching when the screen goes full black or white (eg loading screens) it may cause some desync and the stream will start to drop frames, eventually it will fix by itself but it could take some time, the fastest solution is to open the home menu for a few seconds and then resume the game, for usb stream you can try setting the --desync-fix flag (this will introduce glitches).<br>Common issues<br>After copying the sysmodule to the sd atmosphere won't boot anymore<br>This happens if you have too many sysmodules or ones particulary heavy like sysftpd, remove them to launch SysDVR.<br>If you really need other sysmodules at the same time you can try using the USB-Only version as it uses less memory (512K vs 3MB)<br>To remove SysDVR delete the /atmosphere/titles/00FF0000A53BB665 folder, to remove other sysmodules if you're not sure about the right ID delete the whole /atmosphere folder and download a fresh copy of atmosphere.<br><br>Homebrews using USB like GoldLeaf or nxmtp won't launch anymore<br>This is because the USB interface is being used by SysDVR, if you're using the full version you can swith streaming modes using the SysDVR Settings homebrew included in the zip.<br><br>When using network stream there's a lot of delay or it increses over time<br>Mpv will use a cache buffer to avoid lag when the connection drops some packets but this increases delay, you can disable it by using --cache=no --cache-secs=0<br><br>The video is laggy or there are a lot of glitches<br>Make sure the connection between the console and your pc is good enough, if streaming via network move both closer to the router or switch to LAN, for USB try using an higher quality wire.</p>

  <h3><a href="/switch/SimonNX">Simon NX</a></h3>
  <p>Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language was written by Charles Kapps[citation needed], who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.<br><br>Features :<br><br>- U can use differents accounts for play.<br>- Highscores<br>- Tactil<br>Controls : - Double Touch or D-pad + A : Menu Selection - Short Touch or Short A : enable color - - : Back to menu - : Restart game - Plus : Exit game</p>

Your goal is to defeat enemies, collect treasure and defeat bosses on your way.<br><br>Controls:<br>A - Fire (Pistol/Magic Claw/Dynamite)<br>B - Jump<br>X - Switch weapon<br>Y - Melee attack<br>Minus - open in-game menu<br>D-Pad - walk left/right, look up/down, climb up/down<br>You can also use the left analog to do anything the d-pad does, but it's still a bit wacky and not recommended.<br>There are also touch controls emulating the d-pad, which are leftovers from the Android version. They will be removed in a next beta release. <br><br>Bugs:<br><br>- not all levels are yet implemented, the game is playable to the 10th level, 11 is playable but very buggy and not yet complete<br>- analog controls are wacky (use the d-pad)<br>- music does not yet work, but in-game sounds do<br>- FPS drops to 55 in docked mode, making the sound a bit distorted<br><br>Cheats:<br><br>You can modify your game saves by editing /switch/claw/SAVES.XML file. </p>

  <p>About<br>I started this project as a convenient way to interact with the Switch over the network. Simply run the provided .nro file included and connect to your device via port 5050 to access a Unix-esque shell. A full list of currently-supported commands can be provided by typing 'help' at the prompt.<br><br>For more information, or to report a bug, check out the project on GitHub:<br>https://github.com/Cesura/nxsh<br><br>Connecting <br>Linux/BSD/Mac OS<br>First ensure that you have the 'telnet' client installed on your local machine (it may or may not be bundled with your base distribution). For Mac users, I recommend installing the client via the Homebrew package manager. Then, connect in via:<br><br>$ telnet [IP address] 5050<br><br>Windows<br>The built-in Windows telnet client does not play nicely with nxsh, so I recommend installing PuTTY. Note that connecting via a \"raw\" connection instead of a 'telnet' one will avoid a pesky 'command not found' message upon initialization of the shell. The telnet protocol sends some garbage text as it's negotiating the connection, so if you want a clean-looking shell, ditch that and go for a raw socket.</p>

This will dump all keys up to that point regardless which firmware it's run on.<br><br>Notes<br>To get keys ending in 06, you must have firmware 6.2.0 installed<br>No one knows package1_key_06, it's derived and erased fully within the encrypted TSEC payload. While there's a way to extricate tsec_root_key due to the way it's used, this is unfortunately not true of the package1 key<br>If for some reason you dump TSEC keys on 6.2.0 and not fuses (secure_boot_key) you will still get everything except any of the package1 or keyblob keys (without secure_boot_key, you can't decrypt keyblobs and that's where package1 keys live)</p>

  <p>Introduction<br>Slitherlink is a logic puzzle game created in 1989 by Japanese publisher Nikoli, famous for creating Sudoku, among many other puzzle games. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink for more info.<br><br>I discovered the game a few years ago on the Nintendo DS with 'Puzzle Series Vol. 5: Slitherlink', which was never released outside of Japan. It's such a good game I became addicted to it, just like with Picross and Nurikabe.<br><br>This is my version of the game for the Nintendo Switch. It's a rewrite of one of my previous projects for the Dingoo A320. It features 456 levels in four sizes: 5x5 (easy), 7x7, 10x10, 20x20 (hard). There's also a save state function, undo button, and more.<br><br>Rules<br>In SlitherlinkNX, you draw lines on a grid to create a meandering path, following the rules:<br><br>The path must form a single loop, without crossing itself or branching.<br>The numbers indicate how many lines surround each cell. Empty cells may be surrounded by any number of lines.<br>There is one unique solution for each level. You can draw small x's on segments that cannot be connected. You should be able to find the solution by logical deduction only, without guessing.<br><br>For Slitherlink beginners, I strongly recommend to consult the Wikipedia page, especially chapter 'Solution methods', which is a big help at the start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink#Solution_methods<br><br>Controls<br>d-pad: move cursor<br>X/A/B/Y: draw a line, then a cross, then nothing, in the corresponding direction<br>L + X/A/B/Y: draw a cross, then a line, then nothing, in the corresponding direction<br>R: undo previous action<br>+: open menu, allowing to: retry, save state, or quit<br><br>Credits<br>Development: Tardigrade (http://beyondds.free.fr/)<br>Original game: Nikoli (http://www.nikoli.com/)<br>Puzzles: Krazydad (http://www.krazydad.com/slitherlink/)<br>Font: Chopin Script<br>Sounds: Junggle<br>Background: aopsan</p>

  <h3><a href="/switch/pplay">pplay</a></h3>
  <p>pPlay is a video player for the Nintendo Switch. pPlay support most popular video formats, have subtitles (embedded ass) and http streaming support.<br><br>Usage<br>Use left/right to switch menu's and windows... select a media and... have fun.<br>Notes<br>pPlay should be able to play most media. While 720p should be mostly fine, 1080p support can vary with medias and bit rates. If so (audio de-sync for example), increasing buffering can help in most situation. This can be done in the main menu (left). Please note that increasing the buffer size will have some side effect like longer loading and seeking time, but also to stop a video (buffers needs to be released). This is more visible when using http streams, of course.<br><br>pPlay can stream media from an http server with directory listing enabled. To do so, you must edit the pPlay configuration file (pplay.cfg) to add your server address (NETWORK = 'http://samples.ffmpeg.org/';). Please note that you need a good and stable network connection for this, and you will probably have to set buffering to \"VeryHigh\" for smoother experience.<br><br>pPlay will extract media information in background, but i did spot a very few files which make the device crash. If so, you can disable this in pPlay configuration file (pplay.cfg): CACHE_MEDIA_INFO = 0;<br><br>pPlay will push the cpu speed when a 1080p media is played, and restore previous speed when paused or stopped. This is safe but can be disabled in the main option menu (left).<br><br>Please note that there is a (big?) delay when switching video/audio/subtitles streams to see the change. This is worked on but in the meantime, be patient :)</p>

Add there the Title IDs and the audio files to play when that title is opened.<br><br>This way, when there's nothing opened and you're in Home Menu play.wav file would be played, and while BotW is opened aud.mp3 would be played (even if you're on Home Menu and the app is minimized)<br>This should work with any game, but the only system title working is the Home Menu.<br>If there's an audio set to a title id equal or lower than 0100000000001000 (Home Menu's one) the audio set to that ID will play any time there's no game opened.<br>Looks like opening hbmenu stops the audio playback, but when returning to Home Menu it should start again.<br>Any problems you have, ask them on my Discord server (Nintendo H&H server), or ask them on the release GBAtemp thread of ModuleMania.</p>
