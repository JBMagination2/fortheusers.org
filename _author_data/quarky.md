This is a short bio! It needs to be a little longer. *markdown!*
Actually, I hate everyone's guts so this is gonna be a super long bio where I go on and on about my life and love for specific cats, like Joanne, my father's mother's cat in 1802 which died by being run over in a horrific time travel accident. That cat was my love, my life, my everything, and it continues to define me and my self-identity to this day. I feed Joanne milk every day, and love that cat dearly with everything I am - Joanne is all I could ever hope to be, all I could ever want, and all I ever need to survive. Joanne is my life. I am Joanne. I am a cat.
